##  Wireless Communication: ESP32-to-ESP32 Data Exchange

ESP32-to-ESP32 communication is a key component of this project, enabling the direct and wireless exchange of data from various sensors—such as accelerometers and load cells—without relying on a central router. By leveraging protocols like **Wi-Fi (TCP)** or **ESP-NOW**, two ESP32 boards can seamlessly transmit and receive sensor data to ensure efficient, low-latency data collection and storage.

Within the CRUTCH system, this capability allows for:

-  Real-time, bidirectional communication between multiple crutches or between a crutch and a central logging/display unit.
-  Live sharing of motion and force data, including acceleration and load readings.
-  Remote monitoring and feedback by healthcare professionals, improving rehabilitation and gait correction.

This direct communication channel enhances the system’s **efficiency, adaptability, and responsiveness**, ensuring users receive timely support and feedback that promotes comfort, stability, and safety.
